    <h3>We're Fast</h3>
    <p>Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Take your time. Speed will come later. There comes a nice little fluffer. Use what you see, don't plan it. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.</p>

    <h3>We're Secure</h3>
    <p>I want everybody to be happy. That's what it's all about. It's important to me that you're happy. Every time you practice, you learn more. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.</p>

    <h3>We're Simple</h3>
    <p>Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Do an almighty painting with us. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy.</p>

    <h3>We're Always There</h3>
    <p>I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.</p>
