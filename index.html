        <h3>We're Fast</h3>
        <p>Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Take your time. Speed will come later. There comes a nice little fluffer. Use what you see, don't plan it. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.</p>

        <h3>We're Secure</h3>
        <p>I want everybody to be happy. That's what it's all about. It's important to me that you're happy. Every time you practice, you learn more. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.</p>
